Dropbox
=======

CodePath project. Week 1.

iOS app to demo Dropbox welcome, sign-in/create flow.

Time spent: ~6 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:

User can tap through the 3 welcome screens.
User can follow the create user flow.
On the create user form, the user can tap the back button to go to the page where they can sign in or create an account.
Before creating the account, user can choose to read the terms of service.
After creating the account, user can view the placeholders for Files, Photos, and Favorites as well as the Settings screen.
User can log out from the Settings screen.
User can follow the sign in flow.
User can tap the area for "Having trouble signing in?"
User can log out from the Settings screen.

Optional: Add a detail view for one of the files (a photo in my case) and implement favoriting the file.
Optional: You should be able to swipe through the welcome screens instead of just tapping them.

Option not done (yet?)
Optional: Add UITextFields for the forms so you can actually type in them and handle dismissing the keyboard.
